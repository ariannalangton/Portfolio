## Overview

For this project, I built tables on [python](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/main/generated_business/generated_business_data.ipynb) for a pretend but realistic business. I then created a database using postgresql on PGadmin 4 following the [database schema](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/main/generated_business/business_schema.png). I will answer the following questions by anazling the data in SQL, and then build the corresponding dashboards on Tableau.
