## Overview

For this project, I created data tables using [python](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/main/generated_business/generated_business_data.ipynb) for a pretend but realistic business in the U.S for 2024. I then built a database by importing the tables into PGadmin 4 following the [database schema](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/main/generated_business/business_schema.png) I created. The data tables used are included in the data folder. I answered the following business questions by using postgreSQL to analyze the data in order to provide key business insights. In addition, I displayed the resultant data for each query ran on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arianna.langton5684/viz/GeneratedBusinessDashboards/q19?publish=yes) for easy data visualization and understanding. Also, the SQL queries ran and resultant data generated for each question is uploaded in the corresponding question folder.
