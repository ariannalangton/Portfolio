### Facebook Ad Campaign Analysis

To get an overview of the entire project, please go to the [README](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/main/ad_campaign_comparison/README.md) file in the ad campaign comparison folder. In this folder there are three files; an executive summary of the project,  a screenshot of the dashboard I created on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arianna.langton5684/viz/FacebookAdCampaignReachAnalysis/Dashboard1), and the python notebook I created using google colab to analyze the data. For this part of the project, i analzyed the data provided by a digital media specialist who ran an ad through Facebook's ad platform. I analyzed the statistical significance of the demographic data, focusing on age and gender. Additionally, I examined the times of day when the ads receive the most views. I also plan to calculate the expected conversion rate, click through rate, and impressions to conversion rate using a 95% confidence interval. 

A quick overview of the results is as follows:

- Males viewed the ad significantly more than females,  in terms of reach and impressions, which was confirmed through statistical testing. There was some indication that the reach-to-impression ratio between genders may differ, the p-value of 0.08 suggests that further investigation is needed to draw firm conclusions.
- The age group 55-64 stood out as the most frequent viewers, with a significant 99% difference from the lowest group, indicating a strong preference for this demographic.
- The ad was most frequently seen during early morning hours, lunch breaks, and late afternoon, aligning with typical routines of the older demographic. However, due to the minor differences in impressions during the top viewing hours, more data is required to determine the most effective time for ad placements.
- It performed well in terms of conversion and click-through rates, surpassing industry averages. The 30% conversion rate is particularly notable, but the relatively low impression-to-conversion rate (1.4%).
