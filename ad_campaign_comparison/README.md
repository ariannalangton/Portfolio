# Facebook, Google, and TikTok Ads Statistical Analysis
# Arianna Langton
##  About

For this project, I received data from a paid digital media specialist who ran ads across Facebook, Google, and TikTok. I will conduct separate analyses for each 
platform, as well as an overall comparison to determine which platform was the most successful based on several key metrics. For each individual analysis, I will 
create Tableau dashboards to visualize the data and utilize Python for detailed analysis, including statistical methods like confidence intervals, 
hypothesis tests, and regression analysis. This folder contains Executive Summaries for all four analyses, covering the overview, data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and 
results. Additionally, the corresponding notebooks and dashboards will be provided.
