## Google Ad Campaign Analysis

To get an overview of the entire project, please go to the [README](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/main/ad_campaign_comparison/README.md) file in the ad campaign comparison folder. In this folder there are multiple files; screenshots of the dashboard I created on Tableau [Google Dashbaord](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arianna.langton5684/viz/GoogleAdCampaignAnalysis/Story1#1) and the [python notebook] I created using google colab to analyze the data. For this part of the project, I analyzed the data provided by a digital media specialist who ran an ad through Google's ad platform. I analyzed the statistical significance of the demographic data, focusing on age and gender. Additionally, I examined the times of day when the ads receive the most views and analyzed the keyword search data, finding the CPC and most clicked keyword.

The following is a summary of the methods used and results
