# Arianna Langton - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Arianna! I have an analytical background in Physics and currently, I am on track to complete the Advanced Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have developed a strong foundation in the physical sciences and mathematics. My passion for mathematics and problem-solving has naturally led me to pursue a career in data analytics. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
