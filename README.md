## About
Hi, I'm Arianna! I have an analytical background in Physics and currently, I am on track to complete the Advanced Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have developed a strong foundation in the physical sciences and mathematics. My passion for mathematics and problem-solving has naturally led me to pursue a career in data analytics. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing Industries and Countires for Investments

**Code:** [(Investment Analysis)](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/38d1a4317bf731a6ed63411959ac17e9273022d3/inevstor_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Use skills to clean and investigate data following EDA process. Analyze data for companies in different industries and countries.

**Description:** I provided insights to an imaginary investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into unicorn companies–companies that are valued at over one billion dollars. The data I used for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. The investor wants companies in the hardware industry based in Beijing, San Francisco, and London. They also want to investigate companies in the artificial intelligence industry based in London. They requested a list of the top 20 countries sorted by company valuations in each country as well as a global valuation map of all countries except United States, China, India, and United Kingdom

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Results:** 
The analysis identified eight companies that meet the criteria for the Hardware and Artificial Intelligence industries. These companies are: Bitmain, Global Switch, Chipone, Density, BenevolentAI, Geek+, TERMINUS Technology, and Tractable. Additionally, the top five countries ranked by valuation are Germany, Sweden, Australia, France, and Canada. A plot of the top twenty companies is available in the notebook. It is also noteworthy that Europe has a high concentration of unicorn companies in a specific region.

### Analyzing Unicorn Companies and Investment Data

**Code:** [(unicorn_companies.ipynb)](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/23547f2771f055c2d4e124c110c900657fcff94c/unicorn_companies.ipynb)

**Goal:** Use skills to clean and investigate data following EDA process. Analyze data trends and find 'Unicorn Companies.'

**Description:** I provided insights to an imaginary investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into unicorn companies–companies that are valued at over one billion dollars. The data I used for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. I will use this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommendations for next steps to the investing firm.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that there are 1074 unicorn companies represented in this dataset. Some companies took longer to reach unicorn status but have accrued high valuation as of March 2022. Companies could take longer to achieve unicorn status for a number of reasons, including requiring more funding or taking longer to develop a business model.

### Analyzing Meteroite Landings Recorded by NASA
**Code:** [(NASA_Meteorite_data_analysis.ipynb)](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/ef320e76983f81345d6d69b4d4bc14628d79b3f7/NASA_Meteorite_data_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Use skills to clean and investigate data following EDA process. Find and analyze most common mass, year, geographical location, name type, and meteorite class.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of meteorite landings from the 1400s to 2014. The dataset included name, id, name type, class, mass, fall type, year, and location. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the most common type, year, and landing location of the meteorites.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Plotly Express

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that the year with the most meteorites was 1998. However, the year with the most missing data was 2004 and was followed closely by 2003, which could have skewed the data. For location, the most common spot was (0,0), which is most likely an error. The second most common was in Antarctica. The average mass of all the meteorites was 14020 grams. The average mass was also calcualted for year as well as meteroite class. Ofcourse there are many other characteristics that could have been investigated, but this was enough for my goal. 

### Chaotic Systems of Differenital Equations
**Code:** [(Chaotic differential Systems of Equations)](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/504d9f5afff2dddbe197ccc0b9234bba5ea340b6/Chaotic_Systems.ipynb)

**Goal:** Simulate and solve three different chaotic systems of ordinary differential equations; Lorenz, Chua, Rössler. Discover what inital conditions, or coefficients, cause the system to become chaotic attractors. An attractor describes a state to which a dynamical system evolves after a long enough time.

**Description:** Utilized Python to simulate and solve three different chaotic systems of ordinary differential equations; Lorenz, Chua, Rössler. Each system is comprised of their own unique equations and coefficents.
**Skills:** data analysis, data visualization, mathematics.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

**Results:** [(Results Report)](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/8b0abda58593d44e2154e09d479c0a5d6e0bceb7/chaotic%20attractors%20results.pdf)

### League of Legends V13.1 Statistics
**Dashboard:** [(League of Legends V13 Statistics Dashboard IMG)](https://github.com/ariannalangton/Portfolio/blob/5b5126c4eb52a489c2b5a16a198298328f6093d6/league_of__ledgends_dashboard.png)

**Tableau:** [(League of Legends Tableau Dashboard)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arianna.langton5684/viz/leagueoflegendsstats/Dashboard2)

**Goal:** Use League of Legends Champion statistics v13.1 from Kaggle to create a dashboard on Tableau. Analyzed champions and roles by most played, ban rate, and win rate.

**Description:** The project aimed to analyze more than a hundred champions by examining their win, loss, ban, and pick rates. Additionally, I explored the same characteristics for each of the five possible roles.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Results:** By utilizing Tableau's built-in aggregation functions, I determined that Caitlyn was the most played champion, while Zed was the most banned. Furthermore, Singed had the highest win rate among all champions when played in the Mid role, and Mid being the role with the highest overall win rate. Additionally, I visualized the top 8 most played champions and the roles in which they are most frequently selected.

### U.S Women Elected Officials
